# Ey Up 👋

### My name is Supannee 🙋‍♀️

- 🎬 I’m currently working on diffusion models, 3D reconstruction, NeRFs, and perception-based image registration.
- 👩‍💻 I’m currently collaborating with my former postdoc advisor and his Ph.D. student from the University of York. 
- 🌇 Before that I had worked at Snap 👻 for slightly over 4 years.
- 🎏 My main experience has been in 3D computer vision, but I have occasionally worked with deep learning as well.
