# Ey Up 👋

### My name is Supannee 🙋‍♀️

- 🎬 I’m currently working on diffusion models and perception-based image registration.
- 👩‍💻 I’m currently collaborating with my former postdoc advisor and his Ph.D. student from the University of York. 
- 🌇 Before that I had worked at Snap 👻 for slightly over 4 years.
- 🎏 My main experience has been in 3D computer vision, but I have occasionally worked with deep learning as well.
- 🎮 In my spare time, I play Sudoku :memo:, feed my peridot *Miracle* :cherry_blossom: and enjoy *Moo Deng* :hippopotamus:.
